    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in mathematics at Cornell University. My research interests are in combinatorics
    and discrete geometry with an emphasis on polymatroids.</p>
    <p>I served as the Campus Director of the <a href="https://lexington.aopsacademy.org/" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) Academy Lexington</a> from 2020-2021.</p>
    <p>Outside of math, I am a long distance runner and I enjoy spending time with my dog.</p>
