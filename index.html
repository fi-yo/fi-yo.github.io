<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in mathematics at Cornell University. My research interests are in combinatorics
    and discrete geometry with an emphasis on polymatroids. I served as the Campus Director of the Art of
    Problem Solving (AoPS) Academy Lexington from 2020-2021. Outside of math, I am a long distance runner
    and I enjoy spending time with my dog. Email: fy79 at cornell dot edu</p>
